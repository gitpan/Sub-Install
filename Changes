Revision history for Sub-Install

0.90    2006-04-15
        rewrite warning handling:
          reinstall suppresses fewer warnings: only sub redefinition
          relevant warnings warn from caller (like Carp)
        YOUR CODE MAY BREAK:
          the test/code and documentation differed on install_installers
          the code has been changed to match the documentation
